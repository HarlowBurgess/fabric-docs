# Add and manage an event source in an eventstream

Once you have created an eventstream, you can connect it to various data sources and destinations. The types of event sources that you can add to your eventstream include Azure Event Hubs, Sample data, and Custom app. See the [Supported event sources](#supported-event-sources) section for details.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../../includes/preview-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- Get access to a **premium workspace** with **Contributor** or above permissions where your eventstream is located.
- For an Azure Event Hubs source, you need an Azure event hub with event data and appropriate permission to access its policy keys. It must be publicly accessible and not behind a firewall or secured in a virtual network.

## Add an Azure event hub as a source

If you have an Azure event hub created with event data there, follow these steps to add an Azure event hub as your eventstream source:

1. Select **New source** on the ribbon or "**+**" in the main editor canvas and then **Azure Event Hubs**.

1. Enter a source name for the new source and select a cloud connection to your Azure event hub.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/event-streams-source/eventstream-sources-event-hub.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Azure Event Hubs source configuration.":::

1. If you donâ€™t have a cloud connection, select **Create new connection** to create one. To create a new connection, fill in the information of your Azure event hub on the **New connection** page.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/eventstream-eventhub-source-cloud-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the cloud connection in event hub source.":::

   - **Connection name**: Enter a name for the cloud connection.
   - **Connection type**: The default value is `EventHub`.
   - **Event Hub namespace**: Enter the name of your Azure event hub namespace.
   - **Authentication**: Go to your Azure event hub and create a policy with `Manage` permission under **Share access policies**. Then use **policy name** and **primary key** as the **Shared Access Key Name** and **Shared Access Key**.

       :::image type="content" source="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/azure-event-hub-policy-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Azure event hub policy key." lightbox="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/azure-event-hub-policy-key.png":::

   - **Privacy level**: Choose a privacy level for the cloud connection.

1. After you create a cloud connection, select the refresh button, and then select the cloud connection you created.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/cloud-connection-refresh.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the cloud connection refresh.":::

1. Select a **Data format** of the incoming real-time events that you want to get from your Azure event hub.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The event streams feature supports the ingestion of events from Azure Event Hubs in JSON, Avro, and CSV (with header) data formats.

1. Select a **Consumer group** that can read the event data from your Azure event hub and then select **Add**.

After you have created the event hub source, you see it added to your eventstream on the canvas.

## Add a sample data as a source

To get a better understanding of how an eventstream works, you can use the out-of-box sample data provided and send data to the eventstream. Follow these steps to add a sample data source:

1. Select **New source** on the ribbon or "**+**" in the main editor canvas and then **Sample data**.

1. On the right pane, enter a source name to appear on the canvas, select the sample data you want to add to your eventstream, and then select **Add**.
   - **Yellow Taxi**: sample taxi data with a preset schema that includes fields such as pickup time, drop-off time, distance, total fee, and more.
   - **Stock Market**: sample data of a stock exchange with a preset schema column such as time, symbol, price, volume and more.

       :::image type="content" source="./media/event-streams-source/eventstream-sources-sample-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the sample data source configuration.":::

1. When the sample data source is added successfully, you can find it on the canvas and navigation pane.

To verify if the sample data is added successfully, select **Data preview** in the bottom pane.

## Add custom application as a source

If you want to connect your own application with an eventstream, you can add a custom app source. Then, send data to the eventstream with your own application with the connection endpoint exposed in the custom app. Follow these steps to add a custom app source:

1. Select **New source** on the ribbon or "**+**" in the main editor canvas and then **Custom App**.

1. Enter a **Source name** for the custom app and select **Add**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/event-streams-source/eventstream-sources-custom-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the custom app source configuration.":::

Once you've successfully added the custom app, you can view the information of the custom app such as connection string and use it in your application.

The endpoint exposed by the custom app is in the connection string, which is an **event hub compatible connection string**. You can use it in your application to send events to your eventstream. The following example shows what the connection string looks like:

*`Endpoint=sb://eventstream-xxxxxxxx.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=key_xxxxxxxx;SharedAccessKey=xxxxxxxx;EntityPath=es_xxxxxxxx`*

:::image type="content" source="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/custom-app-source-completed.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the custom app source." lightbox="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/custom-app-source-completed.png" :::

## Manage source

- **Edit/remove**: You can select an eventstream source to edit or remove either through the navigation pane or canvas. When you select **Edit**, the edit pane opens in the right of the main editor.

- **Regenerate key for a custom app**: If you want to regenerate a new connection key for your application, select one of your custom app sources on the canvas and select **Regenerate** to get a new connection key.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/regenerate-key-in-custom-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to regenerate a key." lightbox="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/regenerate-key-in-custom-app.png" :::

## Supported event sources

By utilizing the eventstream sources, users can seamlessly incorporate their real-time events into Microsoft Fabric, facilitating efficient and effective data ingestion.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The total count of sources and destinations for one eventstream is **11**.
> - Event data retention in an eventstream is **1 day**, with the potential to extend it and make it configurable in the future.

:::image type="content" source="./media/event-streams-source/eventstream-sources.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the overview of the eventstream source types.":::

The following sources are currently available.

### Azure event hubs

If you already have an Azure event hub set up in Azure, you can utilize that event hub to ingest real-time data into Microsoft Fabric via the event streams feature.

- **Source name**: A meaningful source name that appears in your eventstream.
- **Cloud connection**: You need to establish a cloud connection between an existing event hub and Microsoft Fabric. Once that cloud connection is in place, you can reuse it across multiple eventstreams. To create a new cloud connection, you must provide the **event hub namespace name**, **event hub name**, **shared access policy name** and **primary key**.
- **Data format**: The format of the incoming real-time events that you want to get from your Azure event hub.
- **Consumer group**: The consumer group of your event hub that can read the event data from your Azure event hub.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/event-streams-source/eventstream-sources-event-hub.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Azure Event Hubs source configuration.":::

### Sample data

By utilizing the sample data source (**Yellow Taxi** or **Stock Market events**), you can effortlessly test your configuration without the need for writing any code, as the sample data is pushed directly into your eventstream.

- **Source name**: A meaningful source name that appears in your eventstream.
- **Sample data**: Select either the Yellow Taxi or Stock Market sample data.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/event-streams-source/eventstream-sources-sample-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the sample data source configuration.":::

### Custom application

A custom application enables a streaming endpoint where you can point your existing event hubs or Kafka clients to your eventstream in Microsoft Fabric without needing any code changes.

- **Source name**: A meaningful source name that appears in your eventstream.
